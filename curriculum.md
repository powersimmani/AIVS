# Curriculum

The AIVS curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience that combines theoretical foundations with practical application. The program is structured in three main phases to ensure progressive learning and skill development.

## Program Overview

![Curriculum Overview](assets/program.png)

The AIVS program consists of three distinct but interconnected learning phases:

1. **Pre-session** (2 weeks): Self-paced online learning with curated materials
2. **Main-session** (2 weeks): Intensive in-person training with lectures and hands-on exercises
3. **Self-study** (4 weeks): Independent project development with mentoring support

This structure allows participants to build a strong foundation through guided learning before applying their knowledge in a research context.

## [Pre-session](presession.md)


The Pre-session is designed to ensure all participants have the necessary foundational knowledge before the intensive Main-session begins. It covers the following areas:

| Subject | Topics | Resources |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Mathematics | Linear Algebra, Calculus, Linear Transformations | [Link Math](presession.md#1-basic-math) |
| Machine Learning | Regression, Classification, Neural Networks, Deep Learning | [Link Macine Learning](presession.md#2-basic-online-lectures) |
| Computer Architecture | CPU, GPU, Memory Systems, Binary Logic | [Link Computer Structure](presession.md#3-basic-computer-structure) |
| Computer Networks | IP Addressing, Ports, WiFi, HTTPS, Virtualization | [Link Computer Networks](presession.md#4-basic-computer-network) |
| Operating Systems | Linux Command Line, File Systems, Environment Variables | [Link Operating Systems](presession.md#5-basic-operating-linux-system) |

Participants are encouraged to complete all recommended materials, with additional resources available for those who want to explore specific topics in greater depth.

## Main-session
The Main-session consists of intensive daily training that combines lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions. The schedule is divided into two thematic weeks:

- Week 1: Focuses on fundamental AI and machine learning concepts, essential tools, and basic neural network architectures
- Week 2: Concentrates on specialized AI applications, research methodologies, and advanced topics presented by teaching assistants based on their research areas

Advanced and Advanced Plus level participants contribute to the program by leading selected sessions, particularly in Week 2, where they share their expertise and research experience with new participants. This peer-teaching model enhances learning for both instructors and students while building a collaborative AI research community.

## Self-study

The Self-study phase allows participants to apply their knowledge to research projects of their choice. This 4-week period includes:

- Project proposal development and review
- Regular check-ins with assigned mentors
- Access to computing resources and specialized equipment
- Weekly group sessions to share progress and get feedback
- Final project documentation and presentation preparation

Participants are encouraged to select projects that align with their interests while demonstrating their understanding of the concepts covered in the program.
