# Curriculum

The AIVS curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience that combines theoretical foundations with practical application. The program is structured in three main phases to ensure progressive learning and skill development.

## Program Overview

![Curriculum Overview](assets/curriculum_overview.png)

The AIVS program consists of three distinct but interconnected learning phases:

1. **Pre-session** (2 weeks): Self-paced online learning with curated materials
2. **Main-session** (2 weeks): Intensive in-person training with lectures and hands-on exercises
3. **Self-study** (4 weeks): Independent project development with mentoring support

This structure allows participants to build a strong foundation through guided learning before applying their knowledge in a research context.

## [Pre-session](presession.md)


The Pre-session is designed to ensure all participants have the necessary foundational knowledge before the intensive Main-session begins. It covers the following areas:

| Subject | Topics | Resources |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Mathematics | Linear Algebra, Calculus, Linear Transformations | [Link Math](presession.md#1-basic-math) |
| Machine Learning | Regression, Classification, Neural Networks, Deep Learning | [Link Macine Learning](presession.md#2-basic-online-lectures) |
| Computer Architecture | CPU, GPU, Memory Systems, Binary Logic | [Link Computer Structure](presession.md#3-basic-computer-structure) |
| Computer Networks | IP Addressing, Ports, WiFi, HTTPS, Virtualization | [Link Computer Networks](presession.md#4-basic-computer-network) |
| Operating Systems | Linux Command Line, File Systems, Environment Variables | [Link Operating Systems](presession.md#5-basic-operating-linux-system) |

Participants are encouraged to complete all recommended materials, with additional resources available for those who want to explore specific topics in greater depth.

## Main-session

The Main-session consists of intensive daily training that combines lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions. The schedule is divided into two thematic weeks:

### Week 1: Foundational ML Concepts

- Day 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals
  - Evaluation metrics and methodologies
  - Loss functions and optimization techniques
  - Practical lab: Implementing basic ML algorithms

- Day 2-3: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
  - Neural network architecture
  - Backpropagation and gradient descent
  - Practical lab: Building and training simple neural networks

- Day 4-5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Image data and preprocessing
  - CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, etc.)
  - Practical lab: Implementing CNNs for image classification

### Week 2: Advanced ML Concepts

- Day 1-2: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Sequential data processing
  - LSTM, GRU, and attention mechanisms
  - Practical lab: Text generation and sequence prediction

- Day 3: Transformers
  - Self-attention and multi-head attention
  - Transformer architecture
  - Practical lab: Implementing a simple transformer model

- Day 4: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Generative vs. discriminative models
  - GAN training dynamics
  - Practical lab: Creating a basic GAN

- Day 5: Self-supervised Learning
  - Contrastive learning
  - Recent advances in self-supervised approaches
  - Practical lab: Implementing a self-supervised learning task

Each day includes theoretical sessions in the morning and practical implementation in the afternoon, with evening sessions for discussion and review.

## Self-study

The Self-study phase allows participants to apply their knowledge to research projects of their choice. This 4-week period includes:

- Project proposal development and review
- Regular check-ins with assigned mentors
- Access to computing resources and specialized equipment
- Weekly group sessions to share progress and get feedback
- Final project documentation and presentation preparation

Participants are encouraged to select projects that align with their interests while demonstrating their understanding of the concepts covered in the program.

## Learning Resources

Throughout all phases of the program, participants have access to:

- Comprehensive lecture notes and presentation slides
- Code repositories with example implementations
- Research papers and review articles
- Online forums for discussion and collaboration
- Office hours with instructors and teaching assistants

## Evaluation Methods

Learning progress is assessed through multiple methods:

- Pre-session qualification test
- Daily quizzes during the Main-session
- Comprehensive examination at the end of the Main-session
- Project evaluation based on technical merit, innovation, and presentation

These assessments help ensure participants are gaining the intended knowledge and skills while providing opportunities for feedback and improvement.
