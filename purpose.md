# Purpose and Objectives

## Program Vision

The AIVS was established to create a collaborative environment where undergraduate students can develop a strong foundation in AI through intensive learning and hands-on project experience. Our vision is to provide undergraduates with foundational AI knowledge and hands-on experience that prepares them for further studies or entry-level positions in the field.

## Multi-level Purposes

### Instructors' Purpose
- Create a structured environment that motivates continuous self-improvement in AI knowledge
- Develop experience in mentoring students and team members, valuable for future faculty or senior engineering roles
- Build a repository of comprehensive teaching and presentation materials for future reference

### Participants' Purpose
- Gain in-depth knowledge and research experience in AI
- Enhance qualifications for graduate school admission or industry employment
- Build a professional portfolio demonstrating AI skills and project experience

### Research Center's Purpose
- Meet the growing demand for AI education among university students
- Cultivate early-stage researchers who can contribute to research projects and internships
- Strengthen the center's position as a hub for AI education and research

## Program Objectives
- Provide over 100 hours of structured AI learning and project work
- Verify knowledge acquisition through a three-stage evaluation process
- Enable participants to develop portfolio-quality projects
- Create opportunities for presentations and research showcases

## Participant Benefits
- Program certificate signed by the supervising professors
- Portfolio of presentations, experiment codes, and other project materials
- Reference letters for graduate school applications or employment, based on AIVS project and program contributions
- Mentorship from experienced researchers and faculty members

## Promotion and Contribution System
- New participants join as the Beginner group
- After completing the Beginner level, participants can progress to Advanced and Advanced Plus levels in subsequent sessions
- Advanced and higher-level participants contribute to the program by leading 2 basic lecture or practice sessions each
- This system enhances learning through teaching and contributes to the program's sustainability

Through this multi-faceted approach, AIVS aims to create a sustainable ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders while advancing AI education and research within the university community.
