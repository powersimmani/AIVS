# RC4 AIWS Seminar 2025 Winter

Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

Following the success of previous training programs, the Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science (RC4) at Ghent University Global Campus conducted a winter school program in 2025 together with the 3D Vision School. This collaborative initiative was designed to enhance undergraduate students' understanding of their fields and develop their practical research skills using math and machine learning. The winter program culminated in presentations where participants shared their research outcomes. For detailed inquiries about presenters and presentation materials, please contact the individual students using the contact information provided in each presentation file or contact the responsible TA.

## Seminar Presentations

The presentations were held across two days, February 25th and 26th, 2025, providing an invaluable opportunity for knowledge exchange and feedback.
