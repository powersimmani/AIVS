# RC4 IRTP Seminar 2025 Winter

Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

**[Building on the success of training programs conducted since 2023](../showcases.md),** The Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science (RC4) at Ghent University Global Campus conducted a winter school program in 2025 together with the 3D Vision School. This initiative aimed to enhance undergraduate students' understanding of AI and related research areas while developing their practical research skills using math and machine learning. As part of this effort, the program included IRTP seminars and culminated in research presentations where participants showcased their findings. For details about the presenters and their materials, please refer to the contact information in each presentation file or reach out to the responsible TA.


The following table presents the list of IRTP supervisors and advisors for this winter's seminars:

| Supervisor | Advisor | Program Title |
