# RC4 IRTP Seminar 2025 Winter

Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

This winter, the Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science at Ghent University Global Campus organized two programs: the AI Winter School and the 3D Vision School. These programs aimed to enhance undergraduate students' understanding of AI and related research areas while developing their practical research skills in mathematics and machine learning applications. As part of these programs, participants attended IRTP seminars and culminated their experience with research presentations showcasing their findings. For additional information about presenters or access to presentation materials, please refer to the contact details provided in each presentation file or contact the program TA directly.

The following table presents the list of IRTP supervisors and advisors for this winter's seminars:
