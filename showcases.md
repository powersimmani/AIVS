# AIVS Oral and Poster Presentations Showcase

## Oral Presentations
AIVS provides students with opportunities to develop their presentation skills and share their research findings through various seminar presentations. Each student receives at least two 2-hour rehearsal sessions to refine their presentations.

## Poster presentations (IGC Research Showcase)

The IGC Research Showcase is a joint academic event involving students and faculty from the four universities affiliated with the Incheon Global Campus (IGC) in Songdo, Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ). The participating universities are:

- State University of New York Korea
- University of Utah Asia Campus
- George Mason University Korea
- Ghent University Global Campus

The IGC Research Showcase was held on May 22, 2023, and May 10, 2024, with the following goals and themes:

- **Event Goal**: Showcase research achievements of the IGC community (students and faculty)
- **Format**: Student-centered poster presentations and demonstrations, as well as faculty-centered oral presentation sessions
- **Theme**: A convergence theme integrating the various topics being worked on by the four IGC universities

AIVS students were encouraged to extend their independent study results into posters and received guidance in presenting these posters at the symposium.
